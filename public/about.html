<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a U.S. Army Veteran with over 17 years of experience in the IT field, I bring discipline,<br> 
  precision, and a deep passion for technology to every project I take on. My career has been<br> 
  rooted in delivering smart, scalable solutions using Microsoft technologies—including SharePoint<br> 
  Online, PowerApps, Power Automate, and the full Microsoft 365 suite.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, I've expanded my expertise into web development, focusing on HTML5,<br> 
  CSS, and Java. This blend of backend experience and front-end creativity allows me to build efficient,<br> 
  user-friendly digital solutions tailored to your needs.</p>

<p>If you're looking for someone who understands both the structure and strategy behind great technology,<br> 
  I&#39d be honored to collaborate with you. Let's bring your next project to life—reach out with your ideas<br> 
  or questions, and let&#39s get started.</p>
